### Explain differences between Java and JavaScript
Java is a statically typed compiled langauge. JavaScript is a dynaically typed interpreted scripting language. I.E. JavaScript doesn't need to be compiled in order to run on a machine.  
JavaScript runs mostly in browser on their javascript engine. Also, the language can run independently with the help of Node runtime. 
### Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: ES6 (es2015) + ES7, versus Typescript.
First strategy of ES6 + ES7 is adding features to the JavaScript language itself. These features coming from ECMASCRIPT foundation first. In ES6/ES7 we see introductions:  
 * Arrow functions
 * Template Literals
 * Promises
 * Block scoped constructs "let" and "const"
 * Classes
 * Modules

These allow for more advanced and organized development in JavaScript.   

TypeScript - a static typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript transpiles back to javascript so it can run on every JS machine.  
Benefits of TypeScript:  
 * Early detection of programming mistakes
 * Prevents run time failures
 * Easier readbility
 * Easier to maintain
 * Easily used for larger projects/enterprise applications.
